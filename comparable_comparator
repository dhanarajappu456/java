comparator

all the wrapper class have implemented the comparable interface , that has compareTo method
usage :  obj1.compareTo(obj2)




when you sort the collection of objects() 
__________________________________________________________________
1)by default natural ordering takes place,(which  uses,   the  ob1.compareTo(ob2) method defintion of the elements, implemeted from comparable ).
eg.sortingi array or Integer object, 

additional info  :
1

each wrapper class has, static method int compare(type, type)(return -1 , 0 , 1) 

the compare is especially to work with primitive type
 

usage 

Integer =   890; 

Integer b  =980; 

Integer.compare(a,b);


2)and also each wrapper class implement the comparetTo function that has signature  obj1.comapreToT(ob2)

this is by implementing the comparable as said, 


this is especillay when you need to compar the object 




2)if you need to modify the custom behaviour of the sort , you  need to implement the comparator interface that has 
compare (ob1, ob2) method , 

and pass this object to the sort method , additionally, 

the sort would call the compar() function
